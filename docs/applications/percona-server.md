Percona Server for MySQL uses the *[MyRocks](https://myrocks.io/)* storage engine,
which in turn uses [RocksDB with Zenfs](zenfs.md) as a backend storage.

As of *[version
8.0.26-16](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/8.0/release-notes/Percona-Server-8.0.26-16.html)*,
Percona Server for MySQL includes built-in support for ZenFS.

See chapter *[MyRocks with
ZenFS](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/8.0/myrocks/zenfs.html)* in the
Percona Server for MySQL 8.0 Documentation for installation instructions and
further information.
